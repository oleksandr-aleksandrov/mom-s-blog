Adds an extra widget to display links to archives grouped by year then by month.

== Description ==

This plugin will add a new widget to the Appearance -> widgets area called "custom archives widget". It allows you to display links to your archive pages in any widgetized area of your website. 
The difference with the default WordPress archives widget is that it groups the links to monthly archives by year (also links), and adds a spiffy
accordion effect to reveal the links to monthly archives when you hover over a year.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the widget to your widgetized area via Appearance -> widgets
